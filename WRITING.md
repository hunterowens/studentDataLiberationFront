# Writing for the Front

To write a guide for your school, either create or edit the README.md file in your school's directory. Each file should have a github flavor markdown table that looks like the one below. 

```
| Data | Method | Result |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| *dataType* | *how you got the records* | *What happened* |
```

Additional files (ie, email templates) should be stored in the directory, but not in the README file.
